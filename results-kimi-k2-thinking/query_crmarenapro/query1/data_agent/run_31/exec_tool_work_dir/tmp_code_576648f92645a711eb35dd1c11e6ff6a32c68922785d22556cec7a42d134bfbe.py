How are you today?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:10] Ali Hussein: Hi Ava, I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:20] Ava Sullivan: I'm great, thank you for asking! I'm glad we could connect. I was looking over the details you provided about your interest in the PulseSim Pro. Is now a good time to discuss?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:30] Ali Hussein: Yes, now works for me. I'm interested to learn more and see how it fits with what we need.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:40] Ava Sullivan: Fantastic! From what you’ve mentioned, you’re interested in four units of the PulseSim Pro, correct?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:50] Ali Hussein: That's right. We want to enhance our simulation capabilities, and the PulseSim Pro seems like a great fit.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:05] Ava Sullivan: Absolutely. The PulseSim Pro is one of our top products for high precision simulation. It offers advanced analytics and seamless integration with existing systems, which is great for boosting efficiency.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:15] Ali Hussein: Those features sound beneficial. We do have a tight timeline for installation, though. Could you tell me more about that?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:30] Ava Sullivan: Certainly. We understand the importance of meeting tight schedules. We usually aim to complete installations within a day and ensure everything runs smoothly. Our technical team is very efficient.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:40] Ali Hussein: That’s reassuring. And as for the budget, how does it look for four units?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:55] Ava Sullivan: Considering your budget is $2,261, I think we can work something out. Each PulseSim Pro unit is priced at $500. For four units, it will come to $2,000. This is below your budget, leaving room for additional services if you wish.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:10] Ali Hussein: That fits really well. I'd like to move forward, but I'll need to consult with the finance team here since I don’t have the final say.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:20] Ava Sullivan: I completely understand, Ali. Would you like me to send over a detailed proposal and pricing information so you can present it to your team?\n[2023-10-21T10:04:25] Ali Hussein: Yes, please. That would be very helpful.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:35] Ava Sullivan: Great! I'll have that to you by the end of the day. Is there anything else you would need from my side?\n[2023-10-21T10:04:40] Ali Hussein: No, that sounds good for now. Thank you, Ava.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:50] Ava Sullivan: You're welcome, Ali. If any questions come up, feel free to reach out. Have a wonderful day!\n[2023-10-21T10:04:55] Ali Hussein: Thanks, Ava.
